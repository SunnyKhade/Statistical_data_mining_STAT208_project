# Employee Attrition Prediction 

This repository contains our final project for STAT 208 (Statistical Data Mining Methods) at the University of California, Riverside. Our objective was to predict employee attrition using a Random Forest model and provide actionable HR recommendations based on key drivers of turnover.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Predict which employees are likely to leave the company.
- Identify top factors influencing attrition.
- Analyze trends by department and age group.
- Recommend data-driven retention strategies.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Classification
- **Feature Importance**: Gini-based variable ranking
- **EDA**: Exploratory analysis by demographics and job role
- **Policy Recommendations**: Age-based, department-based, and feature-based

## 📁 Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `R_Code.Rmd` | R code file for model building, visualization, and feature analysis |
| `R_Code_Knitted_PDF.pdf` | Rendered PDF version of the R notebook |
| `Presentation.pdf` | Final presentation slides |

| `Project_Proposal.pdf` | Initial project proposal |
| `train_dataset.csv` | Training data used for modeling |
| `test_dataset.csv` | Test data used for validation |

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 74.58%
- **Balanced Accuracy**: 74.5%
- **Kappa Score**: 0.49 (moderate agreement)
- **Key Features**: Job Level, Marital Status, Monthly Income, Distance from Home, Tenure

## 🧩 Key Findings
- **Younger employees (20–29)** had the highest attrition rates.
- **Education and Media departments** showed elevated turnover.
- **Remote work and education level** were less predictive than expected.
- Personalized retention strategies (e.g., mentorship, flexible work, recognition) are recommended based on top drivers.
